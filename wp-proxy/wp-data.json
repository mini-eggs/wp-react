The Voice has made some careful and intentional choices when it comes to content in order to produce a high-quality show that will make viewers want to return week after week. First of all, the show holds \u201cblind\u201d auditions. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the format of the show, the judges sit with their backs to the stage in order to eliminate any bias based on gender, race, age, appearance, or any factor that might distract from a contestant\u2019s talent. Another content choice is the decision to pre-screen all contestants beforehand to ensure that only truly talented individuals audition in front of the celebrity judges. This approach differs from other talent shows (cough Idol cough) that profit from subjecting sub-par talent to embarrassment at the hands of merciless judges. The Voice rises above this \u201cclick-bait\u201d type of content and in doing so, cultivates a spirit of profound sincerity. Ultimately, your content is a reflection of your brand, so follow The Voice\u2019s lead and deliver content that is high-quality, intentional and worthy.\r\nTimeliness=Relevance.\r\nThe Voice also understands the importance of timeliness, especially in conjunction with social media. During the blind auditions, the celebrity judges post \u201clive\u201d tweets from their personal accounts in response to the auditions. This tactic is especially interesting (and brilliant) when you consider the fact that the auditions are pre-recorded, so the tweets are not truly \u201clive.\u201d The tweets are crafted perfectly to capture each judge\u2019s unique voice and are scheduled just right so that they post intermittently as the show airs, giving the illusion that the show is happening in real-time and the judges are experiencing it alongside the viewers. See this tweet from Xtina in response to landing an artist, or this tweet from Adam showcasing his (well-crafted) bromance with Blake. We know the tweets aren\u2019t truly live\u2013\u2013the show is pre-recorded, after all! But they still feel so relevant. Brands should take note: always be timely and opportunistic on social media! Followers love to see a brand that is in-tune with cultural happenings.","post_title":"What Can We Learn From NBC\u2019s The Voice?","post_name":"what-can-we-learn-from-nbcs-the-voice","post_image":"http:\/\/ssg.localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/pexels-photo-23970.jpg","post_categories":[{"category_id":3}],"actions":"share","overlay_title":"","overlay_description":"","background_color":"","social_description":"In a world where talent shows are a dime a dozen, there\u2019s one stand-out: NBC\u2019s The Voice.
